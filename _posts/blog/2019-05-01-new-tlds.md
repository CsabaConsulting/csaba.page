Google's new TLDs (top level domains) like `.app`, `.dev`, and `.page` have built-in security features. They force you to serve everything through HTTPS and these TLDs are included on the HSTS preload list without needing individual HSTS registration or configuration.

I moved over my one-page personal website to `csaba.page`. `csabatechnology.github.io` and `csabaconsulting.github.io` will redirect to here. I also bought `csaba.dev` and `csaba.app`, until they have individual content they'll redirect as well.
