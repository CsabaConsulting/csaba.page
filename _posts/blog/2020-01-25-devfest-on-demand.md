Valley Devfest 2019 was a great conference in my opinion. We hired `GMAC` to record 15 of our sessions. This was Andrew's idea and although it might have seemed expensive from some angles, it turned out to be an excellent one (see later). The service included editing and each camera had a videographer who were actively zooming to the presenter or the demonstrations. Overall 15 sessions were recorded plus the opening and closing keynotes (see a full lits later).

It took several hours later in 2019 to nominate all of our talks and complete submission to the so-called [DevFest on demand 2019 conference](https://devfest.withgoogle.com/ondemand) which is an on-line edition of DevFests and contains a collection of the best talks judged by Google out of all the several hundreds of DevFests occured all around the world. The good news is that 6 of our talks got featured! You can spot them easily if you filter by North America region on the [DevFest on demand 2019 website](https://devfest.withgoogle.com/ondemand), but I'll list them all here for completeness:
